# Advanced Data Science Course Projects

This repository contains three comprehensive data science projects completed as part of the COMS4060A/7056A course at the University of the Witwatersrand.

## Project 1: Fuel Consumption Analysis

### Overview
An extensive analysis of a global fuel consumption dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical analysis. The project demonstrates proficiency in handling messy real-world data and extracting meaningful insights.

### Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of user-input data
- Currency and unit conversion across multiple countries
- Feature engineering for enhanced analysis
- Vehicle efficiency analysis across different regions
- Outlier detection and removal
- Analysis of South African fuel price impact on consumer behavior

## Project 2: NYC Taxi Data Analysis

### Overview
A geospatial analysis project focusing on New York City taxi trip data, combining temporal and spatial analysis techniques to uncover patterns in urban transportation.

### Key Features
- Temporal analysis of taxi usage patterns
- Holiday impact analysis
- Location clustering using DBSCAN
- Airport route analysis
- Borough-level analysis using shapefiles

## Project 3: NBA Player Analysis using Dimensionality Reduction

### Overview
An advanced machine learning project focusing on dimensionality reduction techniques applied to NBA player statistics.

### Key Features
- Implementation of multiple dimensionality reduction techniques:
  - Autoencoders
  - Self-organizing Maps (SOMs)
  - t-SNE
  - UMAP
  - Variational Autoencoders
- Comparative analysis of different dimensionality reduction methods
- Cluster analysis on reduced dimensions
